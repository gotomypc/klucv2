A recognition process can be much more efficient if it is based on the detection of features that encode some information about the class to be detected. This is the case of Haar-like features that encode the existence of oriented contrasts between regions in the image. A set of these features can be used to encode the contrasts exhibited by a human face and their spacial relationships. Haar-like features are so called because they are computed similar to the coefficients in Haar wavelet transforms.
